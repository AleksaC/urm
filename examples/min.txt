# Calculate min(x, y, z)

# Check if x is min
1: J(1, 4, 6)
# Check if y is min
2: J(2, 4, 6)
# Check if z is min
3: J(3, 4, 6)

# Increment min by 1, we start from 0 and increment by one until we reach one of x, y, z
# Since we are working with natural numbers this is guaranteed to reach the minimum
4: S(4)

# Go to first instruction
5: J(1, 1, 1)

# Move result to first register
6: T(1, 4)
